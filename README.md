# ptolemy

My reading list. Mostly old papers and books, in no particular order.
I am forgetful, so I need this. This reading history starts on the
brink of 2017, so any interesting things I have encountered before that
point in my life will not be included.

Named after Ptolemy I Soter, who built the Library of Alexandria.
