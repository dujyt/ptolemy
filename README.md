My reading list. Mostly papers and books, in no particular order.
I am forgetful, so I need this. This reading history starts on the
brink of 2017, so any interesting things I have encountered before that
point in my life will not be included. Read my [retrospective](https://blog.veitheller.de/Reading,_The_First_Year.html)
on reading in 2017.

Some of the papers and books do not have links included, because they
might be protected by paywalls or other DRM, because it seems we have to
pay for progress. You might find these papers online anyway,
[SciHub](https://sci-hub.tw) is a great resource; it might be illegal in your
country to use this site, though.

Named after Ptolemy I Soter, who built the Library of Alexandria.

Look at my—frightfully long—[to do list](/todo.md), [the list of things I’ve
already read](/done.md), or [suggest something](https://github.com/hellerve/ptolemy/issues/new)!
